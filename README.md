# Dotfiles

Managed by chezmoi

## Dependencies

In order for these dotfiles to shine I recommend installing:

  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): Alternative to `grep` that respects `.gitignore` and also serves as a better `find`.
  - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Fuzzy finder.
  - [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): Alternative to `cat` with highlighting.
  - [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy): Supercharge your git diffs
  - [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa): ls on steroids

## nvim

You need at least the 0.5.
Once installed you need to run `:PackerInstall`.
After that, run `:LspInstall <language>` to install the lsp servers.

## TODO

  - [ ] ssh?
